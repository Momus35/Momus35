- 👋 Hi, I’m @Momus35
- 👀 I’m interested in:  I have been a research scientist for almost 25 years.  My field is moving to impliment "AI"-based platforms to cancer diagnostics - among other things.  So "AI" and image analysis, etc are where my primary interests lie.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: persuing a degree in mathmatics with a minor in comp sci.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything.  Can't promise to be much help, but I will try and I am a good cheerleader.  
- 📫 How to reach me via email integratethis1@yahoo.com
